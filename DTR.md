### DTR: Define the Relationship
Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.

Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:
What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
How would you describe your work style?
What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
How will we overcome obstacles?
What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

## Project: Fitlit-start-kit

## Group Member Names: Lacy Rudd & David Gitlen

## Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):


Better time management on the project and the other goals outside of this project. MVP: Through iteration 5 and then come back and set up DOM fancy later. 

## Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
Both prefer working in person. Set goals for the day, and set to accomplish. Prefer Turing or house. Lacy is happy to give you rides. 
How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

## Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
  Plan on jsFun & and codeWars in the AM. ( 1 hour a day each minimum) : Practice articulating those. Use them as study breaks. And work through weekend. Thursday the only day we are taking off.
  
  Goal: to finish through iteration 5 by Tuesday.  Clean up // on Wednesday. // Both sleeping thoroughly that night. 

## Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):

Be forward be honest, communicate with scheduling. 

## Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
  Articulating through, data manipulation, concieving of the classes and knowing what we need -- how to create SRP to the smallest level. 

## Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
Split it up as we go. 

## Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
Neither push to master without other: ie you do PR and the other approves it. Figure it out as we go together. 

## Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
Honest, upfront, immediate: it is not personal. 

Project management tools we will use:
Trello. 


Day 1 Agenda:

DTR, look through data, figure out outlines.
